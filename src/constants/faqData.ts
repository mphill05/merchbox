      "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCREEN PRINTING AND DIRECT TO GARMENT PRINTING (DTG)?",
    content: `Let's break it down!


    Screen printing is like making a stencil. You have a screen with tiny holes, and you put ink on it. Then you press the screen onto a shirt, and the ink goes through the holes and prints your design. There is one screen for single colored art, and up to 8 screens for multi colored art. Screen printing works great for big, bold designs with super bright colors but isn't as effective for photorealistic imagery, which brings us to DTG!
    
    
    Imagine a very large printer that sprays ink right onto your shirt, then the ink becomes one with the fabric. DTG is perfect for super detailed designs and lots of colors that might be tricky for screen printing, and is much easier for smaller quantities.
    
    
    Both techniques have their pros and cons, and we're here to help you choose which one will make your designs shine the brightest!`,

    title: 'HOW CAN I PAY?',
    content: `We strive to make payment as easy as possible. You will be sent an invoice at the beginning of production to cover any upfront costs (blanks, inks, screens, etc) and then a final invoice upon completion of your project, which will need to be paid in full before it leaves our HQ. Payments can be made via Credit Card (recommended for any fast turnarounds) or ACH transfer.`,
